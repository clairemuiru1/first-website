        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <P> I am a student at Moringa  school.<br>
            Over time, I have acquired a diverse set of skills through my journey with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>Firstly, my proficiency in HTML has enabled me to structure web content effectively.<br> Creating semantically sound documents that are both accessible and SEO-friendly. <br>Secondly, CSS has allowed me to style web pages with finesse, mastering layout techniques, responsive design, and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.<br>making my websites visually appealing and adaptable to various screen sizes.<br>

JavaScript has been a game-changer in my skill set, as it empowered me to bring interactivity and dynamic functionality to websites. <br>I have honed my ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), implement AJAX for seamless data retrieval, <br>and develop complex web applications, thanks to my JavaScript expertise. <br>Lastly, I've learned the importance of debugging and problem-solving, a vital skillset in web development,<br> through countless hours of troubleshooting code errors and optimizing performance. <br>These combined skills have made me a well-rounded web developer capable of creating engaging, user-friendly, and feature-rich websites.
